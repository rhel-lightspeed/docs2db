# Open Energy Data Initiative  
**Advancing Analytics and Research Innovation through Improved Data Access**

The Open Energy Data Initiative (OEDI) aims to improve and automate access of high-value energy data sets across the U.S. Department of Energy’s (DOE’s) programs, offices, and national laboratories. Sponsored by DOE, this platform is being implemented by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) to make data actionable and discoverable by researchers and industry to accelerate analysis and advance innovation.

Partners at other national laboratories will help utilize the platform for analysis, can be directly involved in determining requirements, and will be resources for providing new datasets that can be shared with the public to expand innovation.

## What is OEDI?

OEDI is geared toward developing improved open data access to better enable analysis by DOE, national laboratories, industry, and the general public. A robust analysis platform will improve accessibility through a data lake, data catalog, and high-value open datasets hosted on multiple cloud computing platforms.

Cloud vendors will have the opportunity to host high-value data sets that are in demand by data scientists and analysts, entrepreneurs, and industry experts. The data catalog can be utilized to find and access datasets through a variety of cloud hosting vendor sites. The data lake can be used to conduct interesting data mash-ups, deep analytics, and advanced computations for developing new and expanded datasets. The data lake will also enable key analytics tools to simplify processes while also advancing the potential for rapid, complex analysis.

The OEDI project will:

- Make relevant, useful connections between analysts and high-value open data  
- Increase the accessibility and visibility of high-value data sets, distilled into relevant, actionable information  
- Engage key stakeholders to collaborate and determine new data sets and use cases to assist in data analysis  
- Allow construction of new data sets from numerous other varied data to expand the benefits of the data  
- Provide a data lake to enable faster, easier, more advanced analysis and computation to accelerate novel data mash-ups, analysis, and innovation  
- Develop data and computing relationships with cloud computing providers, national labs, and federal agencies

## Why OEDI?

Many researchers have difficulty accessing and utilizing big data and complex data because:

1. Data can be difficult to find and use  
2. There is a lack of publicly available data  
3. It’s often not in standard sizes or formats  
4. Large data sets can be costly to store and manage

OEDI will help remove these barriers and improve accessibility for analysts and researchers. The platform will catalog the data sets and allow users to add public data, too.

## Power of Partnerships

- **Cloud Vendors**: The OEDI project will work closely with various cloud hosting partners to ensure each data set can be publicly hosted and shared on a variety of platforms to eliminate the potential for vendor lock-in. In some cases, high-value data sets will be hosted for free; in other cases, the federal government will pay for the hosting; but in all cases, OEDI data will be open data, available to all.  
- **National Laboratories**: The data and information coming out of our national laboratories are valuable assets. This initiative gives laboratory staff a platform through which they can easily share datasets with the public. Access to big data analytics and computation in the cloud will enable innovation and data mash-ups like never before. Using key analysis tools only found in the cloud, researchers can analyze data faster, industry can leverage large-scale federal datasets, and more.

## How it Works?

- **The Data Lake**: OEDI will build a robust data lake on AWS that will enable analytical functionality and comprehensive data analysis. The data lake will leverage AWS analysis tools that will assist users with consolidating data in non-standardized formats, accelerate analytics, and allow users to download or move small portions of their analysis into their own AWS accounts. To assist scientists and analysts with understanding some of the data analytic possibilities, sample code snippets (Python Notebooks, SQL Statements) will be provided to demonstrate access and query capabilities.  
- **The Data Catalog**: In order to easily find available data, OEDI is creating a data catalog that merges data from multiple cloud hosting locations. The catalog will include metadata, licensing information, provenance, and links to all relevant data locations (if the data is housed on multiple cloud hosting vendor sites). It will be designed to let users get to the data quickly.  
- **Partnership Agreements**: Based on a previous, successful federal partnership with various cloud hosting vendors, OEDI strives to build similar agreements with all major cloud hosting vendors. These partnerships are important for building long-term sustained data hosting solutions that will enable big data to be openly shared with the public in a cost-effective manner.

## What Kind of Data Will Be Included?

OEDI will start with two large datasets — examples of high-impact, high-demand resource data:

- **WIND Toolkit data**: includes meteorological conditions and turbine power for more than 126,000 sites in the U.S. (2007–2013)  
- **National Solar Radiation Database (NSRDB)**: a serially complete collection of hourly and half-hourly values of solar radiation (global horizontal, direct normal, diffuse horizontal) plus meteorological data

Future datasets will be selected by lab researchers and stakeholders. Criteria for inclusion: usefulness to a broad audience, support for grid systems, data from cities and states, technology and market data, utility rates, etc.
