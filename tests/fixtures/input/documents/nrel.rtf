\f0\fs21 \cf2 The \cf3 Open Energy Information (OpenEI.org)\cf2  initiative is a free, open-source, knowledge-sharing platform. OpenEI\
was created to provide access to data, models, tools, and information that accelerate the transition to clean energy\
systems through informed decisions.\

\fs24 The Challenge\

\fs19 Although much of the world\'92s\
energy-related information and\
data are available as resources on\
the Internet, they are dispersed\
among innumerable individuals and\
organizations, available in widely\
disparate formats, and highly vari-\
able in quality and usefulness.\

Linked Open Data\
\cf2 OpenEI supports the U.S. Depart-\
ment of Energy\'92s fulfillment of\
open government standards:\
transparency, public partici-\
pation, and collaboration. As\
a wiki-based platform follow-\
ing Linked Open Data meth-\
odology, OpenEI links the world\'92s\
energy-related information and data with\
the energy community (e.g., policymakers, developers, and researchers).\
The platform provides access to data and empowers the energy community\
to use and contribute to the collection of information and data.\

\fs19 \cf2 The explosive global growth of\
renewable energy is being fueled by\
sun, wind, water\'97and information.\
From R&D data to market trends to\
policy developments, decision makers\
need to collect and synthesize the\
best available energy information.\
The U.S. Department of Energy\'92s\
OpenEI platform aims to be the\
nexus for this vital information.\

able to simply look at the syntax of existing pages (under the\
\'93Edit\'94 tab) and copy it where applicable.\
All members of OpenEI may rate and contribute datasets.\
\cf4 Rating data.\cf2  Aligned with data.gov\'92s format, users rate\
datasets on a five-point scale based on ease of access and\
usefulness of the data and corresponding metadata.\

\fs24 \cf7 Accessing, Using, or Submitting Datasets\

\fs19 \cf4 Contributing data.\cf2  Contributing data to OpenEI is easy\
and requires the user to log in, submit a few key pieces of\
metadata, and then either upload the data directly or\
provide a URL to the data\'92s existing location on the Web.\
\cf4 Finding and downloading data.\
\'95 \cf2 Go to http://en.openei.org/wiki/Main_Page\

The OpenEI approach to data quality is to help with com-\
munity improvement of energy information and data; ensure\
minimum required metadata is included with all contribu-\
tions; and verify source, license, and citation information\
prior to publishing data on OpenEI.\
