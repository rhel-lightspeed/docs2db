<P><I>What are &#147;Renewable Resources&#148;?</I>
<P><B>The term &#147;renewable&#148; is generally applied to those energy resources 
  and technologies whose common characteristic is that they are non-depletable 
  or naturally replenishable.</B>
<P>Renewable resources include solar energy, wind, falling water, the heat of 
  the earth (geothermal), plant materials (biomass), waves, ocean currents, temperature 
  differences in the oceans and the energy of the tides. Renewable energy technologies 
  produce power, heat or mechanical energy by converting those resources either 
  to electricity or to motive power. The policy maker concerned with development 
  of the national grid system will focus on those resources that have established 
  themselves commercially and are cost effective for on-grid applications. Such 
  commercial technologies include hydroelectric power, solar energy, fuels derived 
  from biomass, wind energy and geothermal energy. Wave, ocean current, ocean 
  thermal and other technologies that are in the research or early commercial 
  stage, as well as non-electric renewable energy technologies, such as solar 
  water heaters and geothermal heat pumps, are also based on renewable resources, 
  but outside the scope of this <I>Manual.</I>
<P>For the purposes of establishing a legal regime governing and encouraging private-sector 
  investment in renewable resources and technologies, the policy strategist will 
  make use of three conceptual approaches. As well as the foregoing <B>technical 
  </B>definition, both<B> political</B> definitions and <B>legal </B>definitions, 
  factor into a policy definition of what resources deserve discrete treatment 
  as &#147;renewable resources&#148;.
<P><B><I>Broadly define &#147;Renewable Resources, then clarify that definition 
  by defining each specific renewable resource </I>(<I>e.g., &#147;&#145;geothermal 
  energy&#146; means the heat of the earth.&#148;</I>)</B>
<P><B>From the political perspective,</B> renewable energy resources can be divided 
  into numerous categories depending upon the political goals or objectives under 
  consideration. For example, in a given country, renewable resources may be distinguished 
  by categorizing those which are well established versus those which are underdeveloped; 
  those which have immediate development potential versus those which do not; 
  and those with potential rural versus those with urban customer bases. The political 
  perspective of the policy maker in one country may be to justify different treatment 
  for established resources such as large hydroelectric from nascent resources 
  such as geothermal. In another country, the reverse may be true. Likewise, all 
  of the renewable resources may be treated differently for urban application 
  than for rural application.
<P><B><I>Avoid operational definitions. For example, if different types of hydropower 
  are to be treated differently for political or legal reasons, address such treatment 
  in operational language, not by definition.</I></B>
<P><B>From the legal perspective,</B> existing laws such as land use, water, mining, 
  and hydrocarbon laws need to be scrutinized to determine their potential jurisdiction 
  over and applicability to renewable resources. It is important to define what 
  technologies are to be considered &#147;renewable&#148; for the purposes of 
  any piece of legislation. Such legislation can define &#147;renewable resources&#148; 
  as appropriate, given the state of development of the natural resources in that 
  country. If a court, legislator or executive interprets a law strictly, the 
  term &#147;renewable resources&#148; as used in a piece of legislation means 
  what that specific piece of legislation says it means, but only for the purposes 
  of that specific legislation. Thus, if a law defines coal as &#147;renewable&#148;, 
  but omits wind, this legal definition will prevail without reference to the 
  technical characteristics of either fuel. In most legal regimes, however, the 
  term &#147;renewable energy&#148; is used to distinguish naturally replenishable 
  fuels from those fuels of which the earth is endowed with fixed stocks. The 
  main examples of stock-limited resources are the fossil fuels (principally coal, 
  petroleum, natural gas, tar sands and oil shales) and the nuclear fuels (principally 
  uranium, thorium, deuterium and lithium).
<P><I>Can all Renewables be governed by a common policy?</I>
<P><B><I>Policy makers should be cognizant of the similarities as well as the 
  variations among renewable energy resources.</I></B>
<P>From the perspective of the policy strategist, it may be important to determine 
  whether and to what extent energy plans, laws and regulations may be developed 
  using the generic concept &#147;renewable resources&#148;:
<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT FACE=Symbol>&#183;</FONT> <I>Are the differences among the renewable 
  resources and their applications such that legislation may properly address 
  renewable resources technology by technology?</I> 
  <P><I><FONT FACE=Symbol>&#183;</FONT> Are there sufficient commonalities that 
    renewable resource development may be handled as a generic issue?</I>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<A HREF="p009.jpg"><B> The commercial renewable energy technologies</B></A> 
<P><B><I>Establish an objective, specific to each renewable resource, which is 
  designed to achieve national goals.</I></B>
<P>Fundamentally, the answer depends on why the question is being asked, and in 
  which country the policy is being applied. There are, however, guidelines which 
  may prove useful to policy strategists making this determination in any country. 
  Essentially,<B> form must follow function.</B> In other words, it is essential 
  that the policy strategist understand the nature of each of the renewable resources 
  and the nature of the process by which each of those resources is developed.
<P><B>The resources are fundamentally different.</B> Although any resource that 
  relies on the heat or motion of the earth, the moon or the sun (or the sun&#146;s 
  radiation) to produce power for human consumption is a renewable resource, the 
  ways one harnesses the resources are sufficiently different that laws and regulations 
  governing these resources usually deal with each resource on an individual basis 
  - treating each resource as unique. At present, the major commercial grid-connected 
  renewable resources are hydroelectric, geothermal, biomass, wind energy and 
  solar. In the majority of legal regimes, hydroelectric and geothermal resources 
  are identified as owned in common by the people of the country and husbanded 
  by the government for their benefit.
<BLOCKQUOTE><B><FONT FACE=Symbol>&#183;</FONT> <I>Geothermal resources</I></B> 
  require extraction (and reinjection). Drilling for geothermal resources involves 
  many of the same discrete considerations involved with drilling for petroleum 
  (hydrocarbons) and individual treatment is prudent.
  <p><A HREF="p010a.jpg"><B> Geothermal resources</B></A> </p>
  <B><FONT FACE=Symbol>&#183;</FONT> <I>Hydroelectric resources</I></B> are inextricably 
  linked with surface water rights, including potable water, navigation, irrigation, 
  navigation and recreational rights. The historical complexities of sorting out 
  these juxtaposed rights usually dictate individual treatment of hydroelectric 
  resource issues.

  <FONT FACE=Symbol>&#183;</FONT> <B><I>Wind energy and solar</I> </B>draw on 
  resources - wind and sun energy - generally thought of as being free for the 
  taking. The principal resource issue with both of these renewables is surface 
  land. Therefore there is no general technical requirement for individual treatment. 
  <p><A HREF="p011a.jpg"><B> Wind energy and solar</B></A> </p>
  <B><FONT FACE=Symbol>&#183;</FONT> <I>Biomass</I></B> is a broadly inclusive 
  term, often encompassing wood and wood waste, agricultural waste and residue, 
  energy crops, and - sometimes - landfill gas resources. Resource availability 
  and cost can be highly variable, and resources may require management of a type 
  not frequently required for other renewables. Individual treatment is one method 
  of addressing this complication.

<P><I>What are the renewable energy applications?</I>
<P>Renewable energy applications generally break down into two categories or applications, 
  <B><I>&#147;on-grid&#148;</I> </B>and <B><I>&#147;off-grid&#148;.</I></B>
<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT FACE=Symbol>&#183;</FONT> A <B><I>&#147;grid&#148;</I> </B>may 
  be defined as an integrated generation, transmission, and distribution system 
  serving numerous customers. Characteristically, a grid is a portfolio of generating 
  units operating under the control of a central dispatch center. Grids may be 
  national, regional or local (in the latter case they are typically referred 
  to as <I>&#147;mini-grids&#148;</I>)<I>.</I> 
  <P><FONT FACE=Symbol>&#183;</FONT> <B><I>&#147;On-grid&#148;</I> </B>and <B><I>&#147;off-grid&#148;</I> 
    </B>are terms which describe how electricity is delivered. Technically, every 
    one of the commercial renewable resources can be and have been installed both 
    on-grid and off-grid. Furthermore, although larger megawatt installations 
    tend to be on-grid, large renewable plants may profitably be built <I>&#147;inside 
    the fence&#148; - a</I> term describing a self-generator, a plant built to 
    supply a single customer such as a mine, a manufacturing plant or an agribusiness. 
    Hydroelectric, biomass and geothermal facilities tend to be economical at 
    capacity levels well in excess of one megawatt (1 MW) and, therefore, are 
    typically - but not necessarily - developed and financed as <I>&#147;base 
    load&#148;</I> electricity resources (<I>i.e.,</I> the normally operated generating 
    facilities within a utility system) and connected to a grid. Solar arrays 
    and &#147;wind farms&#148; also can be grid-connected.
  <P><FONT FACE=Symbol>&#183;</FONT> <B><I>&#147;Off-grid&#148;</I> </B>applications, 
    in general, serve only one load, such as a home or small business. Off-grid 
    applications can take many forms, from photovoltaics for an individual village 
    home to centralized windmills to power a village water pump or a commercial 
    battery charging facility. These off-grid applications are most generally 
    used in remote or rural settings.
  <P><FONT FACE=Symbol>&#183;</FONT> <B><I>&#147;Mini-grids&#148;</I> </B>have 
    begun to be developed by system engineers over the past few years, for isolated 
    communities. These systems may integrate wind, solar energy and, in some cases, 
    diesel generators and/or storage systems to provide power from a mix of resources 
    to more than one customer, typically a village or cooperative.

<B>On-Grid Uses</B> 
<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT FACE=Symbol>&#183;</FONT> In addition to generating bulk electricity, 
  the renewable energy technologies can serve a number of other valuable on-grid 
  roles. 
  <BLOCKQUOTE>- For grid support, a power station is constructed somewhere along 
    a transmission line to remedy high resistance in the line. This reduces transmission 
    losses and prevents expensive substation equipment from being degraded by 
    excessive heat (this application is a type of <I>&#147;distributed generation&#148;</I>)<I>.</I> 
    <P><I>- </I>In distributed generation, as opposed to central station generation, 
      power plants are smaller and they exist at more locations on the grid. This 
      reduces transmission costs. Distributed generation tends to yield the largest 
      returns in locations where it averts the need to increase transmission capacity.
    <P>- Biomass and geothermal are well-suited to regeneration.

</BLOCKQUOTE>
<H2><A NAME="a. POLICY BENEFITS OF RENEWABLE ENERGY FACILITIES"></A> a. POLICY 
  BENEFITS OF RENEWABLE ENERGY FACILITIES</H2>
<P><B>Cost-benefit analysis is a generally accepted method of evaluating the value 
  of competing energy sources.</B>
<P>Although a complete list of the benefits of renewable technologies can be very 
  extensive, they can be categorized under four headings: environment, diversification, 
  sustainability and economics.
<P><B><I>Renewable resources are environmentally benign.</I></B>
<P>Renewable energy facilities generally have a very modest impact on their surrounding 
  environment. The discharges of unwanted or unhealthy substances into the air, 
  ground or water commonly associated with other forms of generation can be reduced 
  significantly by deploying renewables. Clean technologies can also produce significant 
  indirect economic benefits. For example, unlike fossil-fuel facilities, renewable 
  facilities will not need to be fitted with scrubbing technology to mitigate 
  air pollution, nor will a country need to expend resources in cleaning up polluted 
  rivers or the earth around sites contaminated with fossil-fuel by-products. 
  Furthermore, they provide greenhouse gas reduction benefits and should a worldwide 
  market for air emission credits emerge as has been predicted, countries with 
  a strong portfolio of renewable energy projects may be able to earn pollution 
  credits which can be exchanged for hard currency. Finally, having a clean environmental 
  profile enhances the attractiveness of renewable projects in the eyes of investors, 
  especially the multilateral development agencies, many of whom operate under 
  guidelines that require the promotion of non-polluting technologies.
<P><B><I>Renewable resources promote energy diversification.</I></B>
<P>Development of a diverse portfolio of generation assets reduces both a country&#146;s 
  dependence on any one particular form of technology or fuel and its vulnerability 
  to supply disruption and price increases.
<P><B>The primary long-term benefit of renewable technologies is that once a renewable 
  project has been constructed, and fully depredated, it becomes a permanent, 
  environmentally dean, and low cost component of a country&#146;s energy system. 
  In effect, the construction of a renewable energy project provides future generations 
  a low cost, energy facility that produces power with little or no environmental 
  degradation.</B>
<P><B><I>Renewable resources are sustainable.</I></B>
<P>Renewable technologies are designed to run on a virtually inexhaustible or 
  replenishable supply of natural &#147;fuels.&#148; Expanding a nation&#146;s 
  electricity supply by attracting investment to renewable energy projects is, 
  by defintion, a strategy for sustainable growth, since operation of the facilities 
  does not deplete the earth&#146;s finite resources.
<P>Renewable energy facilities enhance the value of the overall resource base 
  of a country by using the country&#146;s indigenous resources for electricity 
  generation. Moreover, since these facilities operate on &#147;fuels&#148; that 
  are both indigenous and renewable (as distinguished from imported fossil fuels), 
  they may reduce balance-of-payment problems. Reduced dependence on fuel imports 
  reduces exposure to currency fluctuations and fuel price volatility. The construction 
  and operation of renewable projects normally generate significant local economic 
  activity, often in previously &#147;resource poor&#148; areas of a country. 
  Renewable energy projects thus act as engines for regional economic development. 
  In the case of large scale, on-grid projects, easements will need to be purchased 
  and local workers hired to construct and operate the facility. Frequently, a 
  local industry such as a sugar mill or a paper mill (when biomass technology 
  is employed) will be associated with the development, enhancing the opportunities 
  for joint ventures between local landowners and private investors who may supply 
  technological expertise. Smaller scale facilities often attract local private 
  sector involvement. Local involvement, in turn, stimulates new economic activity 
  in a multiplier effect and adds value to the local tax base.
<P><B><I>Appendix A</I></B><I> provides concise descriptions of renewable energy 
  technologies, their applications and environmental impacts. Readers interested 
  in gaining additional knowledge with respect to any of these technologies should 
  also consult US/ECRE&#146;s sponsoring trade associations, also set forth in<B> 
  Appendix B</B> of the Manual.</I>
<P>
&nbsp;
<H2><A NAME="b. COSTEFFECTIVENESS OF RENEWABLE ENERGY"></A> b. COST-EFFECTIVENESS 
  OF RENEWABLE ENERGY</H2>
<P><B>The ultimate question for the policy strategist is whether power generated 
  from a renewable energy source is affordable given the service it is providing.</B>
<P>Universally, the goal of electric power generation planners is to deliver electricity 
  to the maximum number of customers at the lowest possible price. The political 
  acceptability of power generated from any source will depend upon the ultimate 
  tariff to the consumer relative to the benefits delivered.
<P><I>Does renewable energy generate affordable power?</I>
<P>On a total cost basis, a new, renewable energy, generating facility is often 
  cost competitive with a conventional fuel facility provided that the cost calculation 
  considers long-term fuel costs - and even more so when one considers environmental 
  costs and benefits. Since this generalization is not true in every situation 
  confronting the policy planner, the policy planner will need to apply cost-effectiveness 
  criteria adapted to each situation.
<P><I>What are the applicable cost-effectiveness evaluation criteria?</I>
<P>Any given electric generating technology (including renewables) may be cost 
  effective in one market or application and not in another. There is no simple 
  calculus a policy maker can apply, but a number of established criteria will 
  assist in determining the financial viability of renewable energy generation.
<P><B><I>The quality and quantity of the resource.</I> </B>Quality and quantity 
  of renewable resources may be determined by a government-conducted resource 
  assessment, but private-sector developers commonly have their own pre-feasibility 
  and feasibility studies which can be more accurate measures of the commercial 
  viability of a given project. The measures of resource quality and quantity 
  are unique to each resource, but for each of the renewables, resource quality 
  and quantity affects the energy input to, and the effective capacity of a generation 
  facility. In geothermal resource development, for example, the temperature of 
  the resource and the dissolved impurities determine the requisite production 
  equipment. The cost of production equipment, in turn, affects the installed 
  cost and the per-kilowatt-hour cost of delivered power. In biomass, the quality 
  and BTU content of the fuel will influence installed costs, and operations and 
  maintenance costs.
<P><B><I>The location of the resource.</I></B> Proximity of a resource to a customer 
  base directly impacts costs, as does proximity to an existing infrastructure 
  (roads, transmission lines, etc.), to industry support facilities (concrete 
  plants, etc.), and to the developer&#146;s technology manufacturing base. In 
  the case of geothermal, the depth of the resource is a major cost factor. For 
  the hydro, wind and solar technologies, climatic variations (rainfall, cloud 
  cover, intense storms) affect cost. For biomass, transportation distances between 
  the fuel source and the generating facility may significantly affect the electricity 
  cost.
<P><B><I>Government-imposed costs.</I></B> For the private-sector developer, time 
  is money. The time expended in responding to bid proposals, in obtaining requisite 
  permits, licenses and concessions, and in negotiating contracts increases the 
  costs of renewable projects. The policy maker should consider policies that 
  organize and simplify the local institutional processes. Such policies may prevent 
  adding major costs and time delays to what would otherwise be a highly cost-effective 
  facility. Similarly, government-imposed taxes, fees, tariffs and royalty payments 
  are all passed to the electricity consumer and effect the kilowatt-hour cost 
  of delivered power.
<P>The development process is sufficiently similar that for many purposes the 
  renewable resources may be treated similarly. The development process employed 
  by hydroelectric, geothermal, wind energy, biomass and solar renewable technologies 
  may be described and analyzed in three discrete stages: <B><I>&#147;reconnaissance&#148;, 
  &#147;exploration&#148;</I> </B>and <B><I>&#147;exploitation&#148;.</I> </B>Each 
  technology may use different terms for these three stages, but the concepts 
  are similar.
<BLOCKQUOTE><B><FONT FACE=Symbol>&#183;</FONT> <I>Reconnaissance</I></B> is an 
  activity which determines by visual observation and scientific studies whether 
  an area may be a source of commercially exploitable resources. It does not affect 
  the present surface use of the land. 
  <P><B><FONT FACE=Symbol>&#183;</FONT> <I>Exploration</I></B> is an activity 
    which demonstrates the dimensions, position, characteristics and extent of 
    resources by scientific studies. It may affect the present surface use of 
    the land. An extensive outlay of capital may be required for exploring the 
    potential of some renewable resources such as geothermal and, to a lesser 
    degree, wind and hydro resources. Where resource exploration is expensive, 
    this may necessitate that exclusive rights to the relevant renewable resources 
    in the area be awarded to the explorer. These rights may be granted for a 
    limited term, but if exploration proves the commercial viability of the resource, 
    a private-sector developer will require that the temporary exploration rights 
    be converted to long-term exploitation rights.
  <P><B><FONT FACE=Symbol>&#183;</FONT> <I>Exploitation</I></B> is an activity 
    which enables electricity to be produced from renewable resources, either 
    through the intermediate production of steam or the direct production of electricity 
    from a chemical or mechanical process. Exclusive, long-term rights are prerequisite 
    to the sustainability of this production.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
The expense associated with each phase of resource development has a direct impact 
on the cost-effectiveness of the electricity produced. The first generation facilities 
developed in any resource area are almost always going to cost more per kilowatt 
hour produced than will later facilities, since most of the reconnaissance and 
exploration costs will be included in the cost of the first facility. If, however, 
there is some assurance of a market for power from additional facilities, should 
the initial facility prove feasible, the reconnaissance and exploration costs 
may be allocated over more kilowatt hours thus reducing the initial cost. By allocating 
initial reconaissance and exploration costs over multiple projects, the per kilowatt 
hour cost may be significantly reduced. 
<P><B>Financing costs. </B>For renewables, the bulk of a project&#146;s total 
  lifetime cost is represented by the initial capital cost, and will be incurred 
  before the project ever comes on line. The cost of a renewable energy is in 
  the technology effort exerted at the outset of a project and all of the renewables 
  share <B><I>&#147;front-end-loaded&#148;</I></B><I> </I>cost profiles. Consequently, 
  the majority of new generation facilities are funded through project financing, 
  whereby the principal and interest (and profit) are paid from the proceeds of 
  the project.
<P><A HREF="p020.jpg"><B> Cost of Electricity</B></A>
<P><B>Power purchase agreement.</B> The<B> &#147;power purchase agreement&#148;</B> 
  - the power and capacity contract between the owner of a generating facility 
  and its customers - rather than the credit-worthiness of the developer, collateralizes 
  the loan. Since renewable energy projects are front-end-loaded, the costs of 
  capital significantly affects installed cost. High risk factors associated with 
  initial projects developed in new resource areas also translate into higher 
  costs of capital. The challenge for the country policy maker - especially in 
  a country which seeks to attract initial projects to a new resource area - is 
  to implement new mechanisms to lower financing costs. Development of such mechanisms 
  may prove more productive if done in consultation with the private-sector developer. 
  For example, in some situations, municipal customers may have access to tax-exempt 
  or low interest bonds that can be used to finance energy projects at a lower 
  cost than if they were financed with conventional borrowing.
<P><B><I>In a rapidly advancing technological era, the most prudent course for 
  a decision maker is to avoid reliance on old information as to whether a given 
  renewable technology can fulfill a given energy need.</I></B>
<P><B>System costs.</B> The cost or cost-savings of integrating a given renewable 
  energy generator into a system is difficult to quantify. By diversifying the 
  energy supply mix, a system can protect or buffer the ratepayer from the potential 
  financial risks and volatility of changing fuel prices, changing environmental 
  requirements, and common design flaws that can result in large operational and 
  maintenance costs. Reliance on imported fuels may be eliminated and balances 
  of payment problems thereby reduced. With the exception of biomass, there are 
  no intrinsic fuel costs for an established renewable energy generating facility. 
  Consequently, an established renewable facility serves as a hedge against inflation 
  in an inflationary market. 
<P><I>For an example of a renewable facility as an inflationary hedge one may 
  examine the history of the older hydroelectric power dams. The following chart 
  illustrates the renewable technologies which are currently available in the 
  marketplace.</I>

  be purchased today in forms that are reliable and cost-competitive. 
  <P><FONT FACE=Symbol>&#183;</FONT> &#147;Capacity Factor&#148; summarizes the

  <BLOCKQUOTE>- Geothermal and most biomass plants provide baseload energy. 
    <P>- Most hydro and some biomass plants are highly dispatchable, offering 
      a range of options from baseload to peaking.
    <P>- Run-of-river hydro is intermittent, but variations in its output tend 
      to be slow and predictable.
    <P>- Solar ranges from intermittent to intermediate, depending on how well 
      it matches the pattern of energy usage.
    <P>- Wind is intermittent, but studies have found that most grids can add 
      an intermittent source up to 15% of their capacity without requiring any 
      compensatory action. Higher shares from intermittent sources are usually 
      easy to accommodate.
